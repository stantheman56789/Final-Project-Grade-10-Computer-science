click on the snakesm head to send them back to the 
start temperaly they get faster over time
the lore for the game is as follows
you are a race of treants that have kids by growing 
apples and a group of snakes are coming to eat them
the snakes are a race of hydra its just one but there 
are many of them they are a meance to all of civilized socity
they regualery go to bars and rack up a tab in the 1,000$ 
and destory the bar well drinking they also like eating 
kids if they dont eat one every 3 days they die they will 
eat them faster then they need to for the love of the game
side note for the tree people you are playing as they 
like eating grandmas as feralizer the way the apples 
turn into the kids is that they grow into the tree person 
useing newtreants from the person that ate them and the 
bursting out of them like chest bursters""",1,'yellow')
