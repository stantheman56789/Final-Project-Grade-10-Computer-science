the lore for the game is as follows
you are a race of treants that have kids by growing apples and a group of snakes are coming to eat them
the snakes are a race of hydra its just one but there are many of them they are a meance to all of civilized socity
they regualery go to bars and rack up a tab in the 1,000$ and destory the bar well drinking
they also like eating kids if they dont eat one every 3 days they die they will eat them faster then they need to for the love of the game
side note for the tree people you are playing as they like eating grandmas as feralizer
the way the apples turn into the kids is that they grow into the tree person useing newtreants from the person that ate them and the bursting out of them like chest bursters
